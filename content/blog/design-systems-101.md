# Design Systems 101: A Practical Guide

A design system is more than just a component library—it's a shared language between design and development.

## What is a Design System?

A design system typically includes:

- **Design tokens**: Colors, typography, spacing
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements
- **Patterns**: Common UI patterns and layouts
- **Guidelines**: Best practices and usage documentation

## Why Build a Design System?

### Consistency
Ensures a cohesive user experience across your product.

### Efficiency
Developers and designers can work faster with pre-built, tested components.

### Scalability
Makes it easier to maintain and update your product as it grows.

## Getting Started

1. **Start Small**: Begin with core components (buttons, inputs, cards)
2. **Document Everything**: Good documentation is crucial for adoption
3. **Version Control**: Treat your design system like any other product
4. **Iterate**: Design systems evolve with your product

## Tools I Recommend

- **Figma**: For design work and collaboration
- **Storybook**: For component documentation
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe components

## Conclusion

Building a design system is an investment that pays dividends as your product grows. Start small, document well, and iterate based on feedback.
